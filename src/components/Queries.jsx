                <>
                    Hiring a full-time senior designer is costly, with an annual expense of over $100,000, plus additional costs like benefits and insurance. Finding and hiring a new designer is stressful, and dealing with terminations and turnovers can be challenging.

                    We provide extensive flexibility in requesting designs through our integration with Trello. Clients have various options to submit their design requests, including direct requests via Trello, sharing Google Docs or wireframes, or even recording a brief Loom video for those who prefer a more visual approach.

                    Furthermore, you have the ability to add your brand assets directly to the Trello board, allowing for easy access and seamless collaboration. Additionally, Trello can be integrated with other workflows, such as Slack, to further streamline communication and enhance efficiency in managing your design projects.

                    The delivery time of your designs varies based on the task and its complexity. On average, we strive to deliver within 24-48 hours. For instance, social media designs are typically delivered within hours, while UI designs may take a day or two to ensure meticulous attention to detail.

            answer: (
                <>
                    We recognize that your design needs may vary from month to month, and you may not require a continuous stream of design or development work.
                    <br />
                    That's where our subscription pause feature becomes valuable. Our billing cycles are based on a 22 working-day period. For instance, if you sign up and utilize the service for 11 working days but then decide to pause your subscription, the billing cycle will be temporarily halted. This means that you will have 10 remaining working days of service that can be utilized at any time in the future (utilized within 2 years).

However, with our unlimited revision feature, we guarantee that we will make the necessary adjustments and revisions until the final deliverables meet your exact requirements and expectations.
